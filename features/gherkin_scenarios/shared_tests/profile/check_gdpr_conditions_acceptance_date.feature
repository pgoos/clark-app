Feature: Check GDPR conditions acceptance date
  As a user
  I want to be able to see when I had accepted GDPR conditions

  @requires_mandate
  Scenario: user checks GDPR conditions acceptance date in profiling page
    Given user logs in with the credentials and closes "start demand check" modal

    # open mandate profiling page and check GDPR conditions acceptance date
    When user opens profile menu
    And  user clicks on "Pers√∂nliche Angaben" link
    Then user is on the profiling page
    And  user sees that the GDPR conditions acceptance string ends with current date
