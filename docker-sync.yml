  compose-file-path: 'docker-compose.local.yml'
  verbose: true

  # optional, activate this if you need to debug something, default is false
  # IMPORTANT: do not run stable with this, it creates a memory leak, turn off verbose when you are done testing
  # verbose: false

  # optional, default auto, can be docker-sync, thor or auto and defines how the sync will be invoked on the cli. Mostly depending if your are using docker-sync solo, scaffolded or in development ( thor )
  # cli_mode: 'auto'
  # optional, maximum number of attempts for unison waiting for the success exit status. The default is 5 attempts (1-second sleep for each attempt). Only used in unison.

    notify_terminal: true

    # host_disk_mount_mode: 'cached' # see https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/osxfs-caching/#cached
    # other unison options can also be specified here, which will be used when run under osx,
    # and ignored when run under linux

    # which folder to watch / sync from - you can use tilde (~), it will get expanded. Be aware that the trailing slash makes a difference
    # if you add them, only the inner parts of the folder gets synced, otherwise the parent folder will be synced as top-level folder

    # when a port of a container is exposed, on which IP does it get exposed. Localhost for docker for mac, something else for docker-machine
    # default is 'auto', which means, your docker-machine/docker host ip will be detected automatically. If you set this to a concrete IP, this ip will be enforced
    # sync_host_ip: 'auto'

    # optional, a list of excludes. These patterns will not be synced

    # use this to change the exclude syntax.
    # Path: you match the exact path ( nesting problem )
    # Name: If a file or a folder does match this string ( solves nesting problem )
    # Regex: Define a regular expression
    # none: You can define a type for each sync exclude, so sync_excludes: ['Name .git', 'Path Gemlock']

    # optional, default can be either rsync or unison See Strategies in the wiki for explanation
    # sync_strategy: 'unison'

    # optional: usually if you map groups you want to set the group id of your application container here
    # this does not user groupmap but rather configures the server to map
    # this is only available for unison/rsync, not for d4m/native (default) strategies
    # sync_groupid: '6000'

    # defines how sync-conflicts should be handled. With default it will prefer the source with --copyonconflict

    # optional, a list of regular expressions to exclude from the fswatch - see fswatch docs for details
    # IMPORTANT: this is not supported by native_osx

    # optional: use this to switch to fswatch verbose mode

    # monit can be used to monitor the health of unison in the native_osx strategy and can restart unison if it detects a problem
    # optional: use this to switch monit monitoring on

    # optional: use this to change how many seconds between each monit check (cycle)
